# Laravel Octane

This application uses Laravel Octane, a long-running PHP server. The application bootstraps once and handles many requests within the same process.

- Never store request-specific state in singletons or static properties, because it can leak across requests.
- Use `config('octane.server')` to detect the active driver (`swoole`, `roadrunner`, or `frankenphp`).
- Prefer scoped bindings (`$this->app->scoped()`) over singletons for per-request services.

When working on Octane-specific features (concurrency, shared tables, memory, driver configuration, testing), invoke `octane-development` for detailed rules.
